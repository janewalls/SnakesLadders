# SnakesLadders 

### Play the classic board game against a computer!

This is a test project that was developed when I started learning Java, I am now using this to practice creating CI pipeline

To run, use main method in `Play` class

This is played on the command line, and the number you choose has to be between 1 - 6 (like a normal die).


Created March 2020 for a University project
