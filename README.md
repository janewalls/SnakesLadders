# Welcome to the Snakes and Ladders 

### Play the classic board game with a computer and/or friends!

This is a test project that was developed when I started learning Java

To run use main method in `Play` class, you can choose to add as many players as like.

This is played on the command line, and the number you choose has to be between 1 - 6 (like a normal die).

This project is currently being used to learn and test my Jenkins pipeline

Created March 2020 for a University project
